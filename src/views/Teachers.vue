      <h2>Teachers</h2>
      <p>Interested in having your class attend our workshops and presentations? Funny Pages is open to all students between Grades Four and Twelve but because of space limitations, admission is on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Each school can bring up to thirty students and must have one supervising adult per ten children.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Please contact for more information.</p>
